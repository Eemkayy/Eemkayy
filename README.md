### Hi there 👋
If you're seeing this, that means you're snooping around my profile! 👀 <br>
Anyway, here's some brief overview of what I'm currently doing: <br>

💭 Interested in FS SWE (currently learning JS & React) <br>
🏊 I swim in my spare time, care for a race? <br>
🗨️ I speak 6 different languages (English, Spanish, Catalan, Valencian, French, Russian)<br>
💡 Pronouns are he/him/his<br>
⚡ Fun fact: I played almost every single Yakuza game (judge me... judge me.)<br>
<br>
If that bores you, here's some more boring information, on me! 😎<br>
